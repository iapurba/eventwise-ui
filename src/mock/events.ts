      description: `Get ready for a soul-stirring musical journey as the enchanting band, When Chai Met Toast, embarks on an extraordinary India tour spanning 8 vibrant cities. The atmosphere is set to be nothing short of magical, filled with the mellifluous melodies of "So Beautiful, with You" and other chart-topping hits. As they take the stage, the crowd is greeted with the warmth of a thousand suns, their spirits lifted by the familiar refrain of "Khoj (Passing By)" and "Firefly." The band's euphoric blend of folk-pop will transport you to a whimsical world, reminiscent of the lyrics from "Love You The Same" as they embrace the mantra of hope and resilience. `,
